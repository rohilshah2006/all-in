// This is going to be Wave 1
// We can build on this wave with the following. Enemies and distraction will increase in difficulty and qualtity from this wave
// This is like a base wave

//higher waves, like wave 30 will have lower bosses spawn frequently, without a boss drop
//lower bosses eventually replace the base "enemyTracker", in further waves
