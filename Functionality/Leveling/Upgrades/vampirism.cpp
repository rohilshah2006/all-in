//each time enemy is hit, will heal 0.1% of total dmg dealt with that hit.
// max upgrade, each hit will heal 1% of total dmg dealt by hit, e.g. an attack does 100dmg -> your total heal is 1hp
//keep in mind, player will have hundreds of attacks per second, like 500dps is like 5+ hp per sec
//cannot benefit off ignite and only heals half of it's original from elec field

/*Healing Calculation:

Level Scaling: Healing starts at 0.1% of damage per hit at level 1, reaching 1% at max level.
Skill-Specific Effects:
Ignite: No healing is applied for damage from the "Ignite" skill.
ElectricField: Healing is halved for damage dealt by "ElectricField."
Description:

getDescription() provides the current levelâ€™s healing percentage for easy reference.
Usage:

calculateHealing() returns the amount to heal based on damageDealt and the skillName, allowing integration with other combat systems.*/
