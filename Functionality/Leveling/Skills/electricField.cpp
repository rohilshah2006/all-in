//lightblue transparent overlay, under player
//does slight minimal damage for enemies within the area
//lvl 5 could just be a radius 2x the oriignal size, and does like 1.1x damage, it has a dps
/*Level-Based Scaling:

Each level increases the radius by 20% up to level 5, where the radius doubles.
Damage scales by a factor of 1.1x per level, starting from baseDamage (5.0).
Damage Application:

applyDamage calculates DPS by applying damage every frame based on deltaTime.
The damage applies only to enemies within the radius of the field.
Drawing the Field:

draw sets the field position relative to the playerâ€™s position and renders it as a light-blue transparent overlay.
